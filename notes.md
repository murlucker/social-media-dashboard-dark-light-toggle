#Functional Requirements and Notes

1. Light/Dark Mode toggle -- takes system default settings but can be override by toggle

- What HTML markup (+ "alt" for accessibility of the dark/light mode)

Use fieldset, legend, radio inputs -- https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/forms/good-example/

- Switching between light/dark mode (VIA JS, cause logicaly you need functionality)

- Three toggling options: dark/light/default and Prefers-color-scheme media query -- to change the background color and text styling -- https://codepen.io/renddrew/pen/bRomab

CSS Variables (custom properties) -- https://css-tricks.com/updating-a-css-variable-with-javascript/


2. It's beneficial to write down everything that you can understand how to do, to start with (ex. heading, sub-headings, paragraphs, images, font differences, text and blocks allignment etc.)

3. It's a great practice to go through the project fully to mention each and every part that could be forseen otherwise. Try to mention each small detail that could be forgotten in the end, by adding it in the notes from the very start.
